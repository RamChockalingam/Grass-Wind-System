# Wind-Induced Vibration Energy Harvester (Metal Grass Concept)

This theoretical project explores a **novel method of renewable energy generation** using **grass-shaped metal conductors** mounted on the top floor of open buildings. These conductors interact with strategically placed **neodymium permanent magnets** to convert **wind-induced vibrations** into usable **DC electrical energy**, which can then be stored in a battery.

## Concept Overview

Inspired by natural grass swaying in the wind, this concept envisions flexible metal strands ("metal grass") that oscillate when exposed to airflow. By placing **strong permanent magnets** near these conductors:

- **Motion through magnetic fields** induces an **opposing electric field** (via electromagnetic induction).
- The generated **AC voltage** is rectified into **DC**.
- The DC energy is stored in a **rechargeable battery** for later use.

## Theoretical Principles

- **Faradayâ€™s Law of Induction**: A changing magnetic flux through a conductor loop induces an electromotive force (EMF).
- **Lorentz Force**: Movement of conductors in a magnetic field generates voltage across their length.
- **Vibration-to-Energy Conversion**: Exploits ambient kinetic energy from wind to trigger mechanical motion.
